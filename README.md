## Adding your theme

Community themes are listed on [omarchy.org/themes](https://omarchy.org/themes/).
To get yours on the page, open a pull request with two things.

**1. A screenshot.** Take a 16:9 shot of the theme on a real desktop, then
convert it:

    magick preview.png -strip -resize '1200>' -quality 80 your-theme.webp

Put the result in `assets/themes/`. Name the file after the theme, lowercase
and hyphenated — `your-theme.webp`. Aim for 1200x675; keep it under about
100KB so the page stays quick to load.

**2. An entry.** Add a figure block to `themes/index.html`, in alphabetical
order among the others:

```html
<figure class="themes__theme">
  <a href="https://github.com/you/your-theme"><img src="/assets/themes/your-theme.webp" alt="Your Theme theme" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></a>
  <figcaption><a href="https://github.com/you/your-theme">Your Theme</a></figcaption>
</figure>
```

Both links point at the theme's own repository, which is where people
install it from and where it needs to keep living.

### The screenshot matters

The page is a grid of screenshots — that image is the whole pitch for your
theme, so give it the same care you gave the palette. Show a real session
with a terminal and an editor in it, not an empty desktop. Use the theme's own
wallpaper. Don't scale a small capture up, and don't include a cursor, a
notification, or anything personal you'd rather not publish.

Pull requests without a screenshot can't be merged, because there's nothing
to put on the page.

## Plugins

Plugins aren't in this repository. They're listed on
[omarchyplugins.com](https://omarchyplugins.com/) from the
[marketplace repo](https://github.com/HANCORE-linux/omarchy-plugin-marketplace),
which has its own submission guide.
